# Assignment 05
Implement  in  C++  the  given container(`ADT`)  using  a  given  representation  and  a binary  search tree  (`BST`) as  a  data  structure.  You  are  not  allowed  to  use any container  or  data  structurefrom  STL or from any other library. Do  not  implement  a  separate  class  for  the binary  search  tree(or  for  the  dynamic  array), implement the container directly!
- **ADT SortedList** â€“ using a `BST with linked representation with dynamic allocation`. Every node of the BST will retain the number of elements to the left of the node as well.
